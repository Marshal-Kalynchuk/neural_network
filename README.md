# Custom C++ Neural Network Project

This repository contains my Custom C++ Neural Network Project, a personal endeavor to develop a neural network from the ground up using C++. This project was not just about coding a neural network, but also about delving into the complex mathematics that underpin simple neural networks. Through this project, I extensively explored the capabilities of C++, particularly in areas such as arrays and memory management.

The main focus was on constructing a neural network class, capable of basic operations like feedforward and backpropagation. The code demonstrates meticulous attention to detail in handling arrays, memory allocation, and implementation of neural network concepts. I utilized standard libraries such as `<vector>`, `<iostream>`, and `<math.h>` to support the functionality of the neural network.

Key highlights of the project include:
- Implementation of a feedforward neural network with adjustable layers and nodes.
- Custom functions for backpropagation, error calculation, and weight/bias updates.
- Use of random number generators for initializing weights and biases.
- Handling of data loading, normalization, and display.

This project is a testament to my technical proficiency in C++ and my deep understanding of neural networks. It showcases my ability to integrate complex computational concepts with practical programming skills.
